      <h2>What is a Science Fair?</h2>
      <p>
        A science fair is an event that brings together young, curious minds to explore the mysteries of the universe through research and experimentation. It's not just a competition—it's an opportunity to grow, to question the world, and to develop skills that will serve you in every future endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participating in a science fair builds research skills, strengthens critical thinking, nurtures curiosity, and fosters a love for discovery. Through science fairs, students learn to investigate problems, analyze results, and present findings in meaningful ways. The benefits extend far beyond the classroom: enhanced communication, confidence in public speaking, and exposure to the world of STEM careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        From biology and chemistry to computer science and physics, science fairs offer a platform where your imagination and scientific reasoning take center stage. Whether you're building a robot, analyzing water samples, studying plant growth, or inventing a new device—the fair is where ideas shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section continues with engaging descriptions about global examples, the growth of Nobel laureates who started in school science fairs, and stories of impactful discoveries made by students.

    </section><section id="getting-started">
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    Choosing a science fair project can seem overwhelming at first. But don’t worry! Every big idea begins with a single question. Think about what fascinates you—technology, nature, medicine, chemistry? Start from your interests and build your journey from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step-by-step guidance:
    <ol>
      <li>Identify a broad area of interest.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm specific questions within that area.</li>
      <li>Research your topic to see what has already been done.</li>
      <li>Formulate a hypothesis based on your question.</li>
      <li>Design your experiment—consider materials, time, and method.</li>
      <li>Run your experiments and collect data carefully.</li>
      <li>Analyze results and draw conclusions.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <!-- Continue adding examples, resources, and deeper guidance until this section has ~1500 words -->

  <h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
  <p>
    The scientific method is a systematic way of learning about the world around us. It starts with curiosity and ends with conclusions. Here's how it works:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Noticing something interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Question:</strong> Asking why or how it happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Making a testable guess.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Testing your hypothesis under controlled conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Studying the results and identifying patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarizing what was learned.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <!-- Fill with examples, illustrations, comparisons with real-world applications -->

<!-- Add all remaining sections in a similar structure: Resources, Report, Presentation, Judging, Rules, Awards, FAQ, Teacher Resources, Parents, General Info, Sponsors, etc. -->

      "Science is not only a discipline of reason but, also, one of romance and passion. Every student who dares to ask why, who is bold enough to experiment, is a future scientist in the making. Join us in the Science Fair, not just to compete—but to imagine, to create, and to lead the future. Your journey begins now."
